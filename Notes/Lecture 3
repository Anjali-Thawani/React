1️⃣ What is JSX?
✅ JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It's a syntax extension for JavaScript, often used with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 

JSX allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, which helps to describe what the UI should look like. 

This code is then transformed into regular JavaScript code before being interpreted by the browser.

const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;

In the above example, <h1>Hello, world!</h1> looks like HTML but is actually JSX. 

It gets transformed into a React.createElement() function call, which creates a virtual DOM element representing the <h1> element.

2️⃣ Superpower of JSX
✅ Superpower of JSX are as follows:

1️⃣ HTML in JavaScript: JSX lets you write HTML-like code directly within JavaScript files.
2️⃣ Easy UI Creation: It simplifies building user interfaces by combining HTML structure with 
   JavaScript logic.
3️⃣ Component Integration: JSX integrates well with React's component-based architecture, 
    making UI  development straightforward.
4️⃣ Readability: The familiar HTML syntax in JSX improves code readability and comprehension.
5️⃣ Efficiency: JSX enables efficient UI updates through React's virtual DOM, enhancing performance.
