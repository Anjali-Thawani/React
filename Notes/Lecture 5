1️⃣ What is the difference between Named export, Default export and * as export?
# ✅ In JavaScript, when exporting modules, you have different methods to export functionality from a  module:

  # ▶️ Named exports: 
        With named exports, you explicitly specify which variables, functions, or classes you want to export from a module. You can export multiple entities from a single module using named exports, and you import them by specifying their names when importing.
        
        Example:

        // module.js
            export const foo = 'foo';
            export function bar() { /* function implementation */ }
              
        // Another file
              import { foo, bar } from './module.js';

  # ▶️ Default export: 
        With default exports, you export only one entity as the default export from a module. 
        
        When importing, you can give it any name you want. Default exports are typically used when a module is exporting a single entity, such as a class or a function.
        
        Example:

        // module.js
            const foo = 'foo';
            export default foo;

        // Another file
            import myFoo from './module.js';

  # ▶️ * as export: 
        The * as syntax is used to import all exports from a module as a single object. 
        
        This is useful when a module exports multiple things and you want to import them all under a single namespace.
        
        Example:

        // module.js
            export const foo = 'foo';
            export function bar() { /* function implementation */ }
          
        // Another file
            import * as myModule from './module.js';

            // Now you can access the exports as properties of the myModule object
            
            console.log(myModule.foo);
            myModule.bar();

# In summary:-
        Named exports allow you to export multiple entities from a module.
        Default exports allow you to export a single entity from a module, which can be imported with any name.
        * as export allows you to import all exports from a module as properties of a single object.
