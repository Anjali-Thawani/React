1️⃣ What is NPM?
✅ NPM is a packet manager that is used to manage all the library and package, 
   there is no full-form of it.NPM primarily used for managing dependencies in projects.

2️⃣ What is Parcel-Webpack? why do we need it
✅ Parcel is a fast, zero-configuration web application bundler. 
   It simplifies the setup process by automatically analyzing your 
   project's structure and handling tasks like bundling.

   There are several features of webpack:-
   - Zero config
   - Dev server
   - Hot reloading modulation [HMR]
   - Reliable caching
   - Uses Tree shaking Algorithm
   - Minification
   - Image optimization
   - Code splitting
   - Content hashing

3️⃣ What is .parcel-cache file
✅ The .parcel-cache directory is a folder created by the Parcel bundler to 
   store temporary files that help speed up the build process of your web application.

   -  By storing cached files, Parcel can quickly determine which parts of your 
       project have changed 
  
4️⃣ what is npx?
✅ npx is a command that is use to execute the package.

5️⃣ What is difference between dependencies and dev-dependencies
✅  
| Aspect            | Dependencies                           | DevDependencies                           |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Purpose           | Required for application in production |  Needed for development tasks             |
| Installation      | Installed by default                   | Not installed by default                  |
| Usage             | Required for application runtime       | Used during development tasks             |
| Examples          | Express, React, Lodash                 | Jest, Babel, ESLint                       |

6️⃣ What is Tree Shaking?
✅ 
# Tree shaking is a technique used in modern JavaScript bundlers, such as Webpack and Rollup, to eliminate unused code from your final bundle. The term "tree shaking" comes from the concept of shaking a tree to remove  leaves while keeping the healthy ones.

# Here's how tree shaking works:

⭐ Static Analysis: The bundler analyzes the static import and export statements 
                   in your JavaScript code during the bundling process.

⭐ Module Level Optimization: Tree shaking operates at the level of individual modules. 
                              If a module exports multiple functions, classes, or variables, 
                              but only some of them are used in your application, only the 
                              used parts will be included in the final bundle. 
                              Unused exports and their dependencies are removed.

7️⃣ What is HMR?
✅ Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a feature in modern JavaScript bundlers that 
   automatically updates changes in your code without refreshing the entire web page.
